Description: An integrated model for estimating seasonal changes in abundance 
    and stock composition. Designed and tested using fisheries data, estimates
    of total abundance assume a negative binomial distribution while composition
    estimates assume a Dirichlet-multinomial. Stock-specific abundance is 
    calculated as the product of predicted total abundance and the probability 
    of encountering a given stock in a sample. Seasonal effects are estimated 
    using splines, which are allowed to vary among regions. Interannual 
    variation is accounted for using random intercepts. Splines are generated 
    using mgcv and the full model is fit in TMB. Also includes basic plotting
    functions.
