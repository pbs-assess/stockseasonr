Description: An integrated model for estimating seasonal changes in abundance 
    and stock composition. Designed and tested using fisheries data, estimates
    of total abundance assume a negative binomial distribution while composition
    estimates assume a Dirichlet-multinomial. stockseasonr is intended to 
    generate predictions of composition and group-specific abundance.
    Group-specific abundance is calculated as the product of predicted total 
    abundance and the probability of encountering a given group. It borrows 
    significant functionality from glmmTMB and sdmTMB. Smooth terms can be 
    incorporated using `s()` notation from mgcv and random intercepts following 
    the familiar lme4 syntax. The full model is fit in TMB. Also includes basic 
    plotting functions.
